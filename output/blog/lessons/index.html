    <h1 class="title">Lessons from a hackathon</h2>
    <p><p>This past weekend, I participated in the <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/news-events/conferences/nyuad-hackathon-2013.html">2013 NYU Abu Dhabi International Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab world</a>, a three day hackathon held in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. It was my first time in the Arab region, so it was a fascinating cultural experience (check out the Grand Mosque photo below…). I also ended up meeting the coolest teammates and mentors ever, and we built a video mentoring web + mobile app called TakeFlight that won first place!</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/nyuad/mosque.jpg" alt="The Grand Mosque" /></p>

<p>Since this was a project completed in just two and a half days, there’s not that much of interest to discuss regarding the technical details of building the app. What I’m more interested in writing about some of <strong>the general principles that contributed to our success</strong>, since those are what I really took away from this event. I think some of these principles apply more broadly to software development, and even to completing any kind of creative, collaborative project.</p>

<h2 id="structure-breeds-creativity">1. Structure breeds creativity</h2>

<p>I almost hesitate to call this event a “hackathon” because it was very different from any hackathon I’d ever been to in the US. It was started started in 2011 by an NYU professor named Sana Odeh, and is truly an international event, since the organizers invite students, mentors, and judges from all over the world (especially from Arab countries) to participate. What makes it more unusual is how focused the goal is – rather than hack around on random silly stuff, at this event everyone is working on applications for social good in the Arab world. As much as I love silliness, this was a refreshing change from other hackathons. It feels great to build something with the goal of actually solving a real problem.</p>

<p>However, the focus on building useful products also made it a lot harder to decide what to work on. Normally at a hackathon it’s enough to come up with a silly API mashup that shows coding chops, but that didn’t cut it in this case. Luckily, the entire first morning of the hackathon was dedicated to structured ideation, including group brainstorming and one-minute pitches.</p>

<p>To be honest, when I first heard that half a day was devoted to coming up with ideas, I expected a lot of boredom and unnecessary structure. I would have preferred to just find a team, come up with our best idea in a half-hour brainstorm, and go for it. But in the end, I really ended up enjoying the more structured process.</p>

<p>First, hearing a wide variety of ideas from different types of people helped build connections and starting points to build off of in my brain. <strong>The magic lightbulb appearing above an inventor’s head is a complete myth</strong>, and a dangerous one for anyone who actually wants to be creative.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/nyuad/idea.png" alt="Lightbulb" /></p>

<p>This principle especially applied in this case because I knew nothing about the problems people actually face in the Arab region, and a product is only useful if it solves a real problem. For example, I was surprised to see four or five different groups pitch ideas involving improving driving etiquette – who knew that was such an important problem in that part of the world?</p>

<p>Also, <strong>the first idea isn’t always the best</strong>. My group had come up with a pretty cool idea involving crowd-sourcing map data collection, but one of our mentors forced us to keep brainstorming after we were set on that one. We eventually came up with another idea: a platform that addresses youth unemployment by connecting students with mentors in their career fields of interest, and helping them conveniently schedule videochat mentoring sessions. I wasn’t that into this other idea when I first heard it, but it really grew on me over the course of three days as we built the product, and I’m now confident we made a smart choice. It’s so important to keep brainstorming without settling too early.</p>

<h2 id="team-chemistry-is-everything">2. Team chemistry is everything</h2>

<p>The best part of this hackathon for me, <strong>by far</strong>, was the team I got to work with. Giant shoutout to Team Hashtag Wizard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/nyuad/team.jpg" alt="Team Hashtag Wizard" /></p>

<p>From before the event began, I had been planning to work with my friend Seth Thompson from Yale, since we’d done hackathons together before and knew we worked well as a team. But the rest of the team came together completely serendipitously. Through chance encounters that took place everywhere from airport security to the hotel breakfast room, we met Alex Qin, a Rubyist and git wizard attending NYU; Omar Omran, an iOS developer attending the Lebanese American University; Ramsey Nasser, a NY-based hacker/designer who among other cool stuff developed <a href="http://qlblang.org/">Qlb</a>, a Lisp with Arabic syntax; and Max Stoller, an NYU grad with tons of hackathon experience who won second place in the NYUAD event the first time it was held. Ramsey and Max were there as mentors, which meant they weren’t allowed to write any code.</p>

<p>It’s pretty hard to believe how well our team got along from the outset. Maybe working outside in the sunny 75-degree weather put us all in good moods…</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/nyuad/outside.jpg" alt="Working outside" /></p>

<p>Whatever the reason, all of our group work went really smoothly, as we achieved that elusive balance of staying focused and having a ton of fun along the way. Looking back, I think there were two separate factors that made us a great team.</p>

<h4 id="technical-skill">Technical skill</h4>

<p>The first factor was technical skill. The fact of the matter is, <strong>to quickly develop a great product, everyone needs to be on the same page mentally</strong>. Pure intelligence and quickness are crucial for keeping conversations moving, and software development experience is also important, especially in a hackathon setting where huge architectural decisions are made based on gut feeling and there isn’t really time to learn new technologies.</p>

<p>Seth, Alex and I were able to dive right into the Rails project because of our previous experience with the framework, splitting up both frontend and backend work evenly between us. Omar was fast enough with XCode to singlehandedly develop an entire native videochat-enabled iOS app that interfaced with our server in just two days. Our mentors were also really talented developers and could help us out whenever we got stuck.</p>

<p>Because we were all on the same page, I was able to trust all of my teammates 100% with whatever they were working on without feeling any need to check up on them, and that was a rare and exhilarating experience. I’ve never even laid eyes on a lot of the code that’s in our final product, and I love that that’s the case. I hope I can achieve this level of trust on many software projects to come, but it’s not easy – one person not on the same level as everyone else can tear apart the whole web of trust.</p>

<h4 id="personalities">Personalities</h4>

<p>The second (and far more important) factor, though, was <strong>getting along as people</strong>. We all had a blast the entire time, both while we were coding as well as during breaks. I haven’t witnessed such rapid inside joke creation since being at summer camp as a kid, and I vividly remember my mouth being tired from laughing at some point.</p>

<p>This meshing of personalities definitely led to our success as a programming team, but even that result seems irrelevant compared to the simple fact that <strong>it made the whole weekend so damn fun</strong>. I think that whenever you have a choice over who you work with (e.g. when founding a startup), it’s impossible to overestimate the various positive benefits that can arise from good personality vibes.</p>

<h2 id="edge-case">3. Edge case!</h2>

<p><img src="/images/blog/nyuad/nullpointer.png" alt="Null pointer comic " /></p>

<p>(Comic cred: <a href="http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/">Geek and Poke</a>)</p>

<p>After calling us out a couple times on the issue during our first day of coding, our mentor Max was officially designated “Edge Case,” and he even made a nice sign with those words on it to hold up in our faces. Over the course of three days, he saved us countless times from going down rabbit holes of premature optimization, and made us focus on building the core product. Without his edge case prevention heroics, we would have spent way too much time dealing with useless side considerations that weren’t relevant to our demo, and we never would have finished on time.</p>

<p>Of course, we took this principle to its absolute extreme because of the time constraints we faced in this hackathon. But the general idea is crucial to keep in mind when doing any software development. <strong>What is core to the product, and what can be cut?</strong> In a hackathon, anything in the product demo is core, and absolutely anything else, including any semblance of security, is just useless fluff. Any malicious user could pretty easily mess up our application, but I don’t care – it didn’t happen, and we shipped a great demo. When developing real software, security is obviously not just an “edge case”…but what is? Maybe it’s helpful to</p>
