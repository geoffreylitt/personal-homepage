Bluebooker was a website designed to help students plan long-term course schedules over four years of university, instead of just focusing on one semester. I left the project after our beta was a finalist at the Yale College Council App Challenge, and it's since morphed into Yale Bluprint.

##Collaboration
Built with Stephen Hall and Jan Kolmas. I primarily focused on graphic design, and did a bit of frontend Javascript too. They're continuing to maintain the site as Yale Bluprint.
