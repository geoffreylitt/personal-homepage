YalePulse is a polling website developed for the Yale College Council to gather student opinion. The interface is very simple and focused on maximizing ease of use -- for example, you can answer some questions in a poll and quit halfway. Launching fall 2012.

##Tech Stack
Ruby on Rails on the backend, with some custom JS on the frontend for graphing results. Deployed on Heroku.

##Collaboration
Built with <a href="http://seth.fm" target="_blank">Seth Thompson</a>. I wrote the backend, he did the beautiful design and graph Javascript.
