##Description
I designed the website for my friend Bryan's campaign for Yale College Council Events Director. I also designed his campaign's visual identity.

##Visual Design
The website is no-frills and simply showcases the content, with a classic American color scheme. Many visitors to the site weren't too interested in details, so I made sure the front page contained a personal pitch with all the important info.
