A static website for Deneb Renewable, a solar energy startup based in Tokyo, Japan. I also did the brand design, including the logo and color scheme.

##Visual Design
I designed the logo to be simple and modern, representing the values of a renewable energy company. The stroke over the word "deneb" is a simplified version of a rising sun, and the Museo Slab font used for the logotype accentuates the inherent symmetry in the company's name.

##Tech Stack
The site uses the nanoc static site generator to easily compile versions of the site in both Japanese and English, without having to deploy any dynamic code to the server.
