Hi there! I'm a **web developer and designer**, currently writing code for <a href="http://mubi.com" target="_blank">MUBI.com</a> and studying at Yale University. I have several years of experience building **dynamic web applications** (mainly in **Ruby**, and some **PHP**), as well as designing **static websites**.

I enjoy building **simple and usable interfaces**. You can check out stuff I've built on the <a href="/#projects">projects page</a>. My most recent web project, <a href="http://yaleclassroulette.com" target="_blank">Classroulette</a>, is a serendipity-inducing interface to the Yale course catalog.

I also program in **C**. I'm interested in **robotics** and I've worked with the **Arduino** and **PIC** microcontrollers, mostly working on code that runs a <a href="https://github.com/geoffreylitt/Yale-Formula-Hybrid" target="_blank">hybrid racecar</a>.

I'm available to do <strong>freelance work on web projects</strong>, from simple static site designs to more complex web applications. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:gklitt@gmail.com">gklitt@gmail.com</a>.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello with my <a href="http://lowstrungcellos.org" target="_blank">cello rock group</a>.
