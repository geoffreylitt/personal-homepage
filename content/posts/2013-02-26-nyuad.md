This past weekend, I participated in the [2013 NYU Abu Dhabi International Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab world](http://nyuad.nyu.edu/news-events/conferences/nyuad-hackathon-2013.html), a three day hackathon held in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. It was my first time in the Arab region, so it was a fascinating cultural experience. (That's a photo above of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, which was mind blowing to visit.)

I also ended up meeting the coolest teammates and mentors ever, and we built a video mentoring web + mobile app called TakeFlight that won first place at the hackathon!

Since this was a project completed in just two and a half days, there's not that much of interest to discuss regarding the technical details of building the app (see the [git repo](https://github.com/geoffreylitt/mentorme) if you're interested).

What I'd like to write about instead are three of __the general principles that contributed to our success__. I think these ideas could be useful to keep in mind for anyone thinking of participating in a hackathon, and could also apply more broadly to long-term software development and any kind of creative, collaborative project.

## Lesson #1: Structure breeds creativity

I almost hesitate to call this event a "hackathon" because it was very different from any hackathon I'd ever been to in the US. The event was started started in 2011 by an NYU professor named Sana Odeh, and the organizers invite students, mentors, and judges from all over the world (especially from Arab countries) to participate. What makes it unusual is how focused the goal is -- rather than hack around on random silly stuff, at this event everyone is working on applications for social good in the Arab world. As much as I love silliness, this was a refreshing change from other hackathons. It feels great to build something with the goal of actually solving a real problem.

However, the focus on building useful products also made it a lot harder to decide what to work on. Normally at a hackathon it’s enough to come up with a simple API mashup that shows coding chops, but that didn't cut it in this case. My friend and I tried to think of some ideas on the plane ride there, but didn't come up with much. Luckily, the entire first morning of the hackathon was dedicated to structured ideation, including group brainstorming and one-minute pitches.

Now to be honest, when I first heard that half a day was devoted to coming up with ideas, I expected a lot of boredom and unnecessary structure. I would have preferred to just find a team, come up with our best idea in a quick brainstorm, and go for it. But surprisingly, I really ended up enjoying the more structured process. Hearing a wide variety of ideas from different types of people helped build connections and starting points to build off of in my brain. __The magic lightbulb appearing above an inventor's head is a complete myth__, and a dangerous one for anyone who actually wants to be creative.

This principle especially applied in this case because I knew nothing about the problems people actually face in the Arab region, and __a product is only useful if it solves a real problem__. For example, I was surprised to see four or five different groups pitch ideas involving improving driving etiquette -- who knew that was such an important problem in that part of the world?

Also, the first idea isn’t always the best. My group had come up with a pretty cool idea involving crowd-sourcing map data collection, but one of our mentors forced us to keep brainstorming after we were already kind of set on that one. We eventually came up with another idea: a platform that addresses youth unemployment by connecting students with mentors in their career fields of interest, and helping them conveniently schedule videochat mentoring sessions. I wasn’t that into this other idea when I first heard it, but it really grew on me over the course of three days as we built the product, and I'm now confident we made a smart choice. __It’s so important to keep brainstorming without settling too early__.

## Lesson #2: Team chemistry is everything

The best part of this hackathon for me, __by far__, was the team I got to work with. Giant shoutout to Team Hashtag Wizard.

From before the event began, I had been planning to work with my friend Seth Thompson from Yale, since we'd done hackathons together before and knew we worked well as a team. But the rest of the team came together completely serendipitously. Through chance encounters that took place everywhere from airport security to the hotel breakfast room, we met Alex Qin, a Rubyist and git wizard attending NYU; Omar Omran, an iOS developer attending the Lebanese American University; Ramsey Nasser, a NY-based hacker/designer who among other cool stuff has developed [qlb](http://qlblang.org/), a Lisp with Arabic syntax; and Max Stoller, an NYU grad with tons of hackathon experience who won second place at the NYUAD event in 2011. Ramsey and Max were there as mentors, which just meant they weren't allowed to write any code.

It's pretty hard to believe how well our team got along from the outset. Maybe working outside in the sunny 75-degree weather put us all in good moods...

Whatever the reason, all of our group work went really smoothly, as we achieved that elusive balance of staying focused and having a ton of fun along the way. Looking back, I think there were two separate factors that made us a great team.

#### Technical skill

The first factor was technical skill. The fact of the matter is, __to quickly develop a great product, everyone needs to be on the same page mentally__. Pure intelligence and quickness are crucial for keeping conversations moving, and software development experience is also important, especially in a hackathon setting where huge architectural decisions are made based on gut feeling and there isn't really time to learn new technologies.

Seth, Alex and I were able to dive right into the Rails project because of our previous experience with the framework, splitting up both frontend and backend work evenly between us. Omar was fast enough with XCode to singlehandedly develop an entire native videochat-enabled iOS app that interfaced with our server in just two days. Our mentors were also really talented developers and could help us out whenever we got stuck.

Because we were all on the same page, I was able to trust all of my teammates 100% with whatever they were working on without feeling any need to check up on them, and that was a rare and exhilarating experience. I've never even laid eyes on a lot of the code that's in our final product, and I love that that's the case. I hope I can achieve this level of trust on many software projects to come, but it's not easy -- one person not on the same level as everyone else can tear apart the whole web of trust. Steve Jobs and others have referred to this phenomenon as only having "A Players" on a team. I'm not sure I like that way of putting it, but I know what they mean.

#### Personalities

The second (and far more important) factor, though, was __getting along as people__. We all had a blast the entire time, both while we were coding as well as during breaks.

This meshing of personalities definitely led to our success as a programming team, but even that result seems irrelevant compared to the simple fact that __it made the whole weekend so damn fun__. By the time the award ceremony came around, winning first place was just the icing on the cake compared to the friendships I made. I think that whenever you have a choice of who you work with on a project (e.g. when founding a startup), it's impossible to overestimate the various positive benefits that can arise from good personality vibes.

## 3. Lesson #3: Edge case!

(Comic cred: [Geek and Poke](http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/))

In CS classes you learn to carefully consider edge cases and handle them, but in a hackathon, that mindset will prevent you from ever finishing in time. Our mentor Max called us out so often when we were thinking too much about edge cases that we gave him the official title of "Edge Case." Over the course of three days, he saved us countless times from going down rabbit holes of premature optimization, and made us focus on building the core product. Without his edge case prevention heroics, we would have spent way too much time dealing with useless side considerations that weren't relevant to our demo, and we never would have finished our app. 

Of course, we took this principle to its absolute extreme because of the time constraints we faced in this hackathon. But the general idea is crucial to keep in mind when doing any software development. __What is core to the product, and what can be cut?__ In a hackathon, anything shown in the product demo is core, and literally anything else, including any semblance of security, is just useless fluff. Any malicious user could pretty easily mess up our application, but I don't care -- it didn't happen, and we shipped a great demo. When developing real software, security is obviously not just an "edge case"...but what is? Sticking to a lean development cycle that moves towards an MVP is easier said than done, and __ruthlessly discarding appropriate edge cases is one good way to avoid feature creep and and endless development__.

## Hackathons 

__I'd encourage everyone to participate in hackathons__. There's really no better way to get your hands dirty in a low-risk and enjoyable programming environment. Three days in Abu Dhabi taught me to think in whole new ways about software development, and I was lucky enough to have an awesome time and make some new friends along the way.
